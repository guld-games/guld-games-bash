# Guld Games Bash Client

A Command Line Interface (CLI) for the [Guld Games (gg) group](https://github.com/guld-games/Documents). This CLI lets Linux and MacOS users interact with the [gg contract](https://github.com/guld-games/Documents/blob/master/contracts/gg-agreement.md) and [game sub-contracts](https://github.com/guld-games/Documents/tree/master/contracts/games).

### Group Contract

This CLI lets Linux and MacOS users interact with the [gg contract](https://github.com/guld-games/Documents/blob/master/contracts/gg-agreement.md), including implementation of each of the template transactions.



### Games

##### Lottery

The first game to be playable entirely within the gg interface is [Lottery](https://github.com/guld-games/Documents/blob/master/contracts/games/lottery.md).

This 2 player game is entirely luck and has configurable odds between 1:1 and 1:65535.
